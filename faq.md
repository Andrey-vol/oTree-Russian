#### How can I contribute to oTree?

The simplest way to contribute is to use oTree yourself,
and then send notes about your experience to chris@otree.org.
You could tell us about your experience getting started and any issues you noticed,
even if they are minor.
Your feedback will help us to make fixes in the software or improve the documentation.

#### Are you available for workshops?

Yes, on a paid basis.
Workshops are usually 2-4 days.

No prior experience with oTree is necessary, although participants
should have completed a basic tutorial in Python programming.

I have done workshops at Oxford, Aarhus, Bonn, Cologne, Utrecht, Tilburg,
Exeter, Ann Arbor, Stanford, and GfK Verein.
